Factorio-style modules for Valheim!
Overclock your Kilns, Smelters and Blast Furnaces with Surtling Cores.

The Overclock Cores are created in the forge.
Add them to the Kiln, Smelter or Blast Furnace with [1-8] buttons (do not target the Coal or Ore inputs, but the main structure)
The hover text doesn't show up until there is at least 1 overclocking core in the Smelter.

Productivity stores partial products in an internal buffer, and are released when it reaches 100%.

The modules come with a trade-off, so balance them well!
